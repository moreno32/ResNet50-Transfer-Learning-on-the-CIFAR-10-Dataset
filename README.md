# ResNet50 Transfer Learning on the CIFAR-10 Dataset

## 🔄 Overview:
This project aims to demonstrate the application of transfer learning by fine-tuning the ResNet50 model on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color training images and 10,000 test images, representing 10 classes of objects. The ResNet50 model, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, will be used to classify images in the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## 🎊 Motivation:
Transfer learning has become a popular method in deep learning, allowing researchers and practitioners to leverage the knowledge gained from pre-trained models to perform well on new tasks with limited training data. By applying transfer learning on the ResNet50 model on the CIFAR-10 dataset, this project showcases the effectiveness and efficiency of transfer learning in practice.

## 🏁 Learning Objectives:
1) Understand transfer learning and its benefits
2) Apply transfer learning using the ResNet50 model
3) Classify images in the CIFAR-10 dataset
4) Evaluate the performance of the model

## ⚙️ Technical Aspects:
The project implements transfer learning by fine-tuning the ResNet50 model in Keras. The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, preprocessed and visualized before training. The model's performance is evaluated by calculating its loss and accuracy, and visualizing the results in the form of loss and accuracy curves.
